# Welcome!

Hi! I'm just a web dev and security researcher. Most of my public repos are forks or famous platforms. I will be working on a few applications at once so you are free to look at the list and where I am in the process. Thanks for stopping by!

Here are my projects...

# Dashify
An all-in-one platform for web designers and developers. It combines billing, project management, and technology management all in one, so you are not jumping around from one platform to another.

# Bytr
The decentralized and anonymous OSINT platform with autonomous data mining.

# Daisy
Automate the world with the easiest GUI web scraping and automation application.

# SkyWalker
I do not know exactly what this is. But I can tell you what it is not. It is not a botnet, it is not an exploitation/post-exploitation tool, it is not to play with.

# ZeroHour
An experimental multiplatform worm just for fun.
